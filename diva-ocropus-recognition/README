- Run 'diva-Recognition.sh' to segment text image, recognize the text and compute error rates.
- Three inputs are needs:
	page_image: text image name (all the text image are stroed in 'input' folder)
	path_gt: path to the ground truth ('../../saintgalldb-v1.0/ground_truth') 
	model: newly trained recognition model
- Recognition results are found in 'output' folder named with the image name
	'0001' folder: original recognition results from Ocropus
	'new' folder: contains recognition results, output LSTM locations for characters and output probabilities for each letter
	'GT' folder: copied ground truth of the text image
	'new_GT': selected ground truth corresponding to the results in 'new' folder
