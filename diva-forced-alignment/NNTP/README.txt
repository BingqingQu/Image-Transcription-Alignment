NNTP is the LSTM-RNN token passing software I have developed during my PhD studies to perform word-based handwriting recognition with very large vocabularies. If you use it for a scientific publication, please add a reference to:

A. Fischer, “Handwriting recognition in historical documents,” Ph.D. dissertation, University of Bern, pages 96-100, 2012.
