# Image-Transcription-Alignment
The objective of this framework is alingment between a page image and it transcriptions.
It contains three parts: 
1). Ocropus recognition: using ocropus to run layout analysis, text recognition and probability matrix.
2). Forced alignment: using forced alignment to find mappings between text images of a given handwritten document and their                         respective words in its transcription.
3). Visulisation: using a GUI to visulize the results.

These three parts of functionality can run independently, and a 'README' document can be found to explain how to run it in their folders respectively:

Ocropus recognition is found in the folder 'ocropy-master', where you can find original Ocropus codes, modified text recognition codes in 'div-Recognition' and recognition model training codes in 'div-Trainmodel'.

Forced alignment is found in the folder 'ForcedAlignment'.

Visulisation is found in the folder of 'visualisation'.

To run the complete fromework, please go the folder of 'framework-alignment' and read the 'README' doc.
