- Run 'diva-ImageTranspAlignment.sh' to run the framework 
	- Three inputs are needs:
		page_image: text image name (all the text image are stroed in 'input' folder)
		path_gt: path to the ground truth ('../../saintgalldb-v1.0/ground_truth') 
		model: newly trained recognition model
	- output is found in 'output' folder named with the image name, where the intermediate and final results are saved:
		'0001' folder: original recognition results from Ocropus
		'new' folder: contains recognition results, output LSTM locations for characters and output probabilities for each letter
		'GT' folder: copied ground truth of the text image
		'new_GT': selected ground truth corresponding to the results in 'new' folder 
		'new_proMatrix' folder: probability matrix 
		'new_alignment' folder: aligned results with letter location and word location
